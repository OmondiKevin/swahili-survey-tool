# Swahili Survey Engine: Design Decisions and Implementation Details

This document explains the design decisions and implementation details of the Swahili Survey Engine project.

## Project Overview

The Swahili Survey Engine is designed to provide a comprehensive solution for processing surveys in both English and
Swahili, with support for both text and audio responses. The project follows a modular architecture with clear
separation of concerns, making it easy to maintain and extend.

## Architecture

The project follows a modular architecture with the following key components:

1. **Translator**: Handles translation between English and Swahili
2. **Question Mapper**: Maps survey questions between different formats
3. **Response Parser**: Parses and analyzes survey responses
4. **ASR (Automatic Speech Recognition)**: Transcribes audio responses
5. **Pipeline**: Orchestrates the flow between all components

This modular design allows each component to be developed, tested, and maintained independently, while the Pipeline
component provides a unified interface for the entire system.

## Design Decisions

### 1. Modular Architecture

**Decision**: Implement a modular architecture with clear separation of concerns.

**Rationale**:

- Improves maintainability by isolating changes to specific modules
- Enables parallel development of different components
- Facilitates testing by allowing each component to be tested independently
- Allows for easier extension or replacement of individual components

### 2. Use of Google Cloud Translation API

**Decision**: Use Google Cloud Translation API for translation between English and Swahili.

**Rationale**:

- Provides high-quality translation between English and Swahili
- Offers a reliable and well-documented API
- Supports batch translation for efficiency
- Handles edge cases and nuances of both languages

### 3. Use of OpenAI's Whisper for ASR

**Decision**: Use OpenAI's Whisper model for Automatic Speech Recognition.

**Rationale**:

- Provides state-of-the-art speech recognition for multiple languages, including Swahili
- Offers different model sizes to balance accuracy and performance
- Can run locally without requiring an external API
- Handles various audio formats and quality levels

### 4. JSON for Data Storage

**Decision**: Use JSON for storing survey questions, responses, and analysis results.

**Rationale**:

- Human-readable format makes it easy to inspect and debug
- Widely supported in various programming languages
- Flexible schema allows for easy extension
- Native support in Python through the json module

### 5. Graceful Degradation for Advanced NLP

**Decision**: Implement graceful degradation for advanced NLP features.

**Rationale**:

- Not all users may have access to or need advanced NLP capabilities
- Allows the system to work with basic functionality even without advanced dependencies
- Provides enhanced features when available without making them mandatory

### 6. Comprehensive Error Handling

**Decision**: Implement comprehensive error handling throughout the codebase.

**Rationale**:

- Improves robustness by handling edge cases and unexpected inputs
- Provides clear error messages to help diagnose issues
- Prevents cascading failures by containing errors at their source
- Enhances user experience by gracefully handling errors

### 7. Extensive Logging

**Decision**: Implement extensive logging throughout the codebase.

**Rationale**:

- Facilitates debugging by providing visibility into the system's operation
- Helps track the flow of data through the system
- Enables performance monitoring and optimization
- Assists in diagnosing issues in production

## Implementation Details

### Translator Module

The Translator module uses the Google Cloud Translation API to translate text between English and Swahili. It provides
methods for translating individual strings, dictionaries, and entire surveys. The module handles edge cases such as
empty text and includes proper error handling for unsupported languages.

### Question Mapper Module

The Question Mapper module handles loading survey questions from JSON files, mapping them to different formats, and
validating responses against question types. It supports multiple question types (multiple-choice, yes/no, open-ended)
and provides methods for retrieving questions by ID or type.

### Response Parser Module

The Response Parser module parses and analyzes survey responses, particularly open-ended responses that require natural
language processing. It uses sentence-transformers for advanced text analysis when available, but gracefully degrades to
simpler analysis methods when not. The module provides methods for extracting keywords, identifying themes, and
generating summary reports.

### ASR Module

The ASR module uses OpenAI's Whisper model to transcribe audio responses from Swahili to text. It supports various audio
formats and provides methods for batch transcription and directory processing. The module includes functionality to
ensure audio files are in a compatible format and handles edge cases such as low-quality audio.

### Pipeline Module

The Pipeline module orchestrates the flow between all components, providing a unified interface for the entire system.
It handles loading surveys, processing responses (both text and audio), analyzing results, and saving outputs. The
module includes comprehensive logging and error handling to ensure robust operation.

## Testing Strategy

The project includes a comprehensive test suite for each component:

1. **Unit Tests**: Test individual methods and functions in isolation
2. **Integration Tests**: Test the interaction between components
3. **Mock Tests**: Use mocking to test components that depend on external services

The tests use Python's unittest framework and include proper setup and teardown methods to ensure test isolation.
Mocking is used extensively to avoid actual API calls and file operations during testing.

## Future Improvements

1. **Web Interface**: Add a web interface using Streamlit or Flask to make the system more accessible
2. **Real-time Processing**: Implement real-time processing of audio responses
3. **More Languages**: Extend support to more languages beyond English and Swahili
4. **Enhanced Analysis**: Implement more advanced analysis techniques for open-ended responses
5. **User Authentication**: Add user authentication for multi-user environments
6. **API Endpoint**: Provide a RESTful API for integration with other systems

## Conclusion

The Swahili Survey Engine provides a comprehensive solution for processing surveys in both English and Swahili, with
support for both text and audio responses. The modular architecture, clear separation of concerns, and comprehensive
error handling make it a robust and maintainable system that can be easily extended to meet future requirements.
